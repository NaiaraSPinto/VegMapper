    "s1_proc.py handles this final processing step. It achieves this using helper scripts in the Sentinel directory: **s1_build_vrt.py** and **calc_vrt_stats.py** for the temporal mean, and **remove_edges.py** for removing edge pixels. It takes 5 arguments: path_frame, m1, and m2 (all optional), srcpath, and year (both required). If path_frame is specified, only granules matching path_frame will be processed; otherwise, all path_frames under srcpath/year will be processed. If m1 and m2 are specified, only granules with acquisition month >= m1 and <= m2 will be processed. srcpath should point to where processed granules are stored (see previous section for valid paths). year is the year of granules to be processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes ###\n",
    "\n",
    "* The processing will be slow if srcpath is on AWS S3 or GCS because it requires heavy network I/O between the cloud and your local machine. If srcpath is on AWS S3, it is strongly recommended that you run the processing on AWS EC2.\n",
